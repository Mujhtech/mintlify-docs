## Incidents

Incidents are events that affect the availability of a service. They are usually caused by a failure in the underlying infrastructure, but can also be caused by a failure in the application itself. To see incidents make sure you have subscribe to one or more services. Navigate to the incidents page by clicking on the incidents link in the tabbar browse through the incidents, filter based on date, service, endpoint, status etc.
